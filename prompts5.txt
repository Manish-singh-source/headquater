You are working on an existing Laravel project. The database schema already exists and migrations/models/controllers/routes/views are partially implemented. Your job is to **improve and complete** the existing module as per the following requirements — do NOT rewrite the entire structure, only enhance current code where needed.

Module 5: Products Management 

    -- database columns: 
        'products' table:

        'warehouse_stock' table: 
            id, warehouse_id, product_id, original_quantity, available_quantity, block_quantity
        -- available_quantity = original_quantity - block_quantity 

    -- net_landing_rate = basic_rate + (basic_rate * gst / 100) 
    -- case_pack_quantity = pcs_set * sets_ctn 
    -- vendor_net_landing = vendor_purchase_rate + (vendor_purchase_rate * gst / 100)
    -- status = (active, inactive) 

    -- relationships: 
        -- one to many relationship between warehouses and products 
        -- one to one relationship between products and warehouse_stock 
        -- one to many relationship between warehouses and warehouse_stock
