You are working on an existing Laravel project. The database schema already exists and migrations/models/controllers/routes/views are partially implemented. Your job is to **improve and complete** the existing module as per the following requirements â€” do NOT rewrite the entire structure, only enhance current code where needed.

            -- there is back button for go to back page 
    
        Sub Task 5: multi select delete and multi select status changing
