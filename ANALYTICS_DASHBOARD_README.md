## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Dashboard:
1. Log in to the application
2. Click on "Analytics Dashboard" in the sidebar navigation
3. The dashboard will load with default filters (current month, all brands)

### Using Filters:
1. **To filter by date range**:
   - Select start date and end date
   - Click "Apply" button
   
2. **To filter by specific brands**:
   - Click on the "Select Brands" dropdown
   - Select one or more brands (hold Ctrl/Cmd for multiple selection)
   - Click "Apply" button
   
3. **To reset filters**:

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Efficient Queries**: Uses Laravel's query builder with proper joins and grouping
2. **Date Filtering**: Limits data retrieval to relevant date ranges
3. **Brand Filtering**: Reduces dataset when specific brands are selected
4. **Indexed Columns**: Relies on existing database indexes on foreign keys

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Caching**: Implement Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load charts on scroll for better initial page load
3. **AJAX Refresh**: Add ability to refresh individual sections without full page reload
4. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/Excel export for tables
5. **Scheduled Reports**: Implement automated email reports
