You are working on an existing Laravel project. The database schema already exists and migrations/models/controllers/routes/views are partially implemented. Your job is to **improve and complete** the existing module as per the following requirements â€” do NOT rewrite the entire structure, only enhance current code where needed.

    -- database columns: 
        'sku_mappings' table:

        -- after clicking the button, a form should appear as popup/modal to add a new SKU mapping. 
        -- the form should have fields as upload file (excel file). 
        -- on submitting the form, the excel file should be parsed and all SKU mappings should be stored in the database.

        -- display a list of all SKU mappings in a table view with columns: product sku, customer sku, vendor sku, action (edit, delete). 
    
        Sub Task 1: edit
